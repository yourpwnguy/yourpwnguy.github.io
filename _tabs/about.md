Hi, I’m Aakansh, and I’m really into low-level security stuff like assembly, exploit development, reverse engineering, and malware analysis. These are the areas that excite me the most, and they’re what drive the work I do.

I started with web development, which gave me a good base to build on. Now, I still love web security and enjoy finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

On this blog, I’ll be sharing posts about malware reversing, web security, and CTF challenges. I also like to create tools to automate things, and you can check them out on my GitHub: [yourpwnguy](https://github.com/yourpwnguy).

Looking ahead, my goals are:

1. Hacking while sipping tea (my mom says no to coffee!)
2. Working at top tech companies, where I can legally dig into their systems and find vulnerabilities. The developers can handle fixing them!

Thanks for visiting my profile. I hope you find something useful here. If you have any suggestions or want me to write about something specific, just let me know. I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Cheers,

Aakansh
